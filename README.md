## Technologies Used

## How To Use

To get started simply press play and click on any of the grid cells. Indicated by the cells illuminated in blue, the playhead moves across the grid triggering different notes or drum sounds. 

16.Steps features two synthesizer sounds, each routed through their own respective lowpass filter. The cutoff frequency of each filter can be adjusted using the knob on the left-hand side of the synth controls. 

Each instrument can be muted and includes a 'Clear' button, allowing the user to wipe the instrument's existing cell pattern from the grid. 

The user can also select the option to 'Change Pattern', wiping the existing grid and adding a randomly selected sequence from a set a pre-written patterns. For the Drums section, there are  additional options available for adding rhythmic patterns to the grid.

Volume and Tempo knobs allow the user to adjust the output gain and BPM of the sequencer and a musical notes section displays the currently selected notes with the option to switch to a different set of notes.
